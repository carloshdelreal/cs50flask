## The content

In this webpage, I comment something about my life and the much that I like learning some of the aspects of my professional carreer as Geologist, yes Geologist, not programer, an other related nice topics

## Features of the Page

The page consists of four html documents linked each other in a very hardcoded way, it uses bootstrap for styling and a scss file in which I try to style the best but without complaining so much.

At the bottom of the page you will find arrows that allow to move back and forth of the idea of the text, it also has a navegation panel that was created using bootstrap an the column.

As it was requested the page contains a table that presents some popular minerals and its chemical compositions, an image is also presented in the geophisics section that presents a resistivity profile of the groud for slope stability analisis
